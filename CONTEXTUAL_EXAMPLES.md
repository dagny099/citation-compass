└───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

🚀 ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS
1. 🎯 Literature Review Strategy
   → Use community assignments to organize systematic reviews
   → Focus on 2-3 communities most relevant to your research question
   → Identify "bridge papers" that connect communities for broader context

2. 🤝 Collaboration Identification  
   → Authors in smaller communities (clusters 7-8) may benefit from broader connections
   → Large communities (clusters 1-2) likely have established collaboration patterns
   → Cross-community collaborations have higher impact potential

3. 📈 Research Gap Analysis
   → Low-density regions between communities suggest under-explored areas
   → Papers with high betweenness centrality are key knowledge bridges
   → Recent papers in isolated positions may represent emerging directions

4. 📊 Citation Strategy
   → Cite representative papers from each relevant community (increases visibility)
   → Reference high-centrality papers for methodological credibility  
   → Include recent bridge papers to demonstrate awareness of field connections
